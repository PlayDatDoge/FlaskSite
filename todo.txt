 TODO :




*adding players :
---------------
![depending on how much money you have,based on your league you will be able to spend money to buy players]
[recommender systems - Recommend a player on a good buy [either profitable , fit for the team, or just a good player for a good price]]
[could also just be picked by a user]
[predicting a player's rating / value/ wage - already done but how do i use it ?]

* recommending players 
----------------------

- empty team : recommend based on : players price / potential - overall + predicted value vs real value . (linear regression)
- real team : recommend based on : current squad of players , players price / potential - overall + predicted value vs real value . and more



* Add the list of young promising players that every team should buy if they can.
